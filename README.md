# What is machine learning?

Machine learning is any algorithm in which a computer learns from data and experience in order to minimize or maximize some cost function. Typically this is set up to minimize error or maximize performance accuracy.

# What are the two major subdivisions with machine learning?

The two major divisions in machine learning are supervised and unsupervised learning. Often there are two other categories; deep learning and reinforcement learning, but they are well outside the scope of this course.

# What is the difference between regression and classification algorithms?

Regression algorithms predict a numerical quantity such as age, price or blood pressure. Classification algorithms predict categorical data such as 'is fradulent activity' vs 'is not fradulent activity', 'is a dog' vs 'is not a dog' or which digit is this a picture of? Measuring the performance of these algorithms is substantially different leading to the generalized distincition.

# What type of algorithm would you use to predict which state someone lived in?

A classification algorithm would be most appropriate for predicting a categorical variable such as what jurisdiction an individual lived in.

# What type of algorithm would you use to predict someone's SAT score?

A regression algorithm would be most appropriate for predicting a numerical quantity such as an SAT score.

# What kind of algorithm would you use to group customers into groups based on similar behavior?

A clustering algorithm allows you to group data into homogenous groupings. This is a type of unsupervised learning algorithm and would be most appropriate for this scenario.

# What kind of algorithm would you use to visualize a dataset with 20 variables?

A dimensionality reduction algorithm such as PCA or TSNE would be most appropriate for visualizing a dataset with a large number of features.
